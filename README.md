### About

- I created an Android app in the summer of 2020 during the pandemic, before I started at Haaga-Helia in the autumn. Prior to the project I had little coding experience.
- I began by making a BMI calculation program with Java. Then I made a "Hello World" mobile application. Next, I moved the BMI calculation to the mobile app. I added user inputs, different pages and options.
  I also made the app mobile accessible and fully compatible with Android Talkback. Finally, I published the app on the Google App Store. I haven't updated the app after publishing it.
