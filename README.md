### About

- I created the app during 2020 before I started at Haaga-Helia. Prior to the project I had little coding experience.
- I began by making a BMI calculation program with Java. Then I made a "Hello World" mobile application. Next, I moved the BMI calculation to the mobile app. I added user inputs and pages.
  I also made the app mobile accessible and fully compatible with Android Talkback. Finally, I published the app on the Google App Store. I haven't updated the app after publishing it.
